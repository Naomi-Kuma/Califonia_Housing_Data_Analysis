# 🏡Califonia_Housing_Data_Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project is all about diving into California housing prices using machine learning. 

## 📊 Dataset
We're working with the *California housing dataset*, which includes insights like median income, house age, and location details. Perfect for understanding what affects housing prices!

## 🔍 What We'll Do
These are the steps:
1. *📥 Load the Data*: Read the dataset and take a peek at the structure.
2. *🛠 Handle Missing Data*: Fill in missing values to keep things smooth.
3. *🔢 Convert Categorical Data*: Transform non-numeric data into a machine-friendly format.
4. *📑 Split the Data*: Separate it into training and testing sets.
5. *📏 Scale Features*: Standardize the data for better model performance.
6. *🧠 Train 5 Different Models*:
   - 📈 Linear Regression
   - 🌳 Decision Tree Regressor
   - 🌲 Random Forest Regressor
   - 🔄 Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
   - 🚀 Gradient Boosting Regressor
7. *📊 Evaluate the Models*: Compare results using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score.
8. *✅ Show the Final Results*: See which model performs best!
